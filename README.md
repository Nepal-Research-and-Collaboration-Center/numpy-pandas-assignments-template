# Numpy and Pandas Assignments

Welcome to your Numpy and Pandas assignments! This repository contains two separate assignments where you'll get hands-on experience with data analysis using Numpy and Pandas.

## Assignment 1: Numpy - Temperature Data Analysis

### Instructions:
1. Open the `numpy_assignment.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the tasks.
3. Execute the cells to ensure your code works as expected.
4. Save your changes and push the notebook back to the repository when you're done.

### Tasks:
- Calculate the average temperature for each week.
- Find the day with the highest temperature in each week.
- Calculate the temperature difference between the two weeks for each day.
- Reshape the temperature data to represent 2 weeks by 7 days.
- Display the reshaped data in a table format.

## Assignment 2: Pandas - Traffic Data Analysis

### Instructions:
1. Open the `pandas_assignment.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the tasks.
3. Execute the cells to ensure your code works as expected.
4. Save your changes and push the notebook back to the repository when you're done.

### Tasks:
- Create a Pandas DataFrame using the given data.
- Select and print the traffic data for Intersection 1 on Tuesday.
- Add a new column to the DataFrame representing the total traffic for each day.
- Sort the DataFrame by total traffic in descending order.
- Save the DataFrame to a CSV file named `traffic_analysis.csv`.

## Submission
- Ensure that you have completed all tasks in both assignments.
- Push your changes to the repository.
- Your work will be automatically submitted via GitHub Classroom.
